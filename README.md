# 📘 Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

## 📝 Description

This project demonstrates how to build a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`.

The dataset includes 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses, describing characteristics of cell nuclei (e.g., radius, texture, area, smoothness).

The complete machine learning pipeline includes:

- Preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Train/test split (80/20)
- Model training using `LogisticRegression`
- Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
  - ROC-AUC score
- Visualizations for performance analysis

The code is modular, well-structured, and beginner-friendly — ideal for learning binary classification and model evaluation techniques.
